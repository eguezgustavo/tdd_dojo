# TDD Exercise 1

In this example we are going to create a calculator to show the TDD principle.

## Requirements:

This app is going to have three methods:
- A function to add two numbers so if you run:
  ```
  python3 example.py sum_two_numbers 5 7
  ```
  it will return 12 to the stdout
- A function to subtract two numbers so if you run:
  ```
  python3 example.py sub_two_numbers 5 7
  ```
  it will return "This app can only produce positive results" to the stdout
- A function get the factorial of a number so if you run:
  ```
  python3 example.py fac 3
  ```
  it will return 6 to the stdout


## Starting

This folder has two python files:

    ├── [example.py](/example_1/example.py) - Here you can write your code
    └── [example_test.py](/example_1/example_test.py) - Here you can write your test

You can start working in this exercise. Don´t forget to use the naming [recommendations](./../README.md) for the exercises. Also, consider the "happy path" and the "sad path".
